    <p id="desc">Project 3: Drama

Overview 
Our third project has two goals: (1) to further develop your ability to write about literature, and (2) to develop your ability to create a multimodal text. To that end, Project 3 asks you to analyze a full-length drama, select a key scene in that drama, and then stage that scene for a lay audience who is familiar with the play. You will then present and explain your staging in a multimodal document that has three required parts. 

The Assignment 
Project 3 has three required parts: 
Part 1: Scene Staging
Part 2: Staging Explanation 
Part 3: Works Cited 

Each part is described below—but please note that while they are described separately, they should ultimately form a cohesive whole. 

Part 1: Scene Staging 
In this part, you will “stage” your selected scene by annotating the play’s script using design elements (font colors, highlights, strikethrough, etc.) and illustrating the scene by including images, visuals, sound clips, and songs. Your selected scene should be 2-3 consecutive pages from the textbook. For more information on how to create your Scene Staging, please read the “How Do I Create a Scene Staging?” section of this document. 

Part 2: Staging Explanation 
In this part, you will explain your scene staging in a 1300-word minimum essay. As a writer, you should tell us WHY you staged the scene the way that you did. That is, you will have made some deliberate decisions in your scene staging; the staging explanation should tell your audience what decisions you made, why, and for what purpose. For more information on how to write an effective Staging Explanation, please read the “How Do I Create a Staging Explanation?” section of this document. 

Part 3: Works Cited
As with Projects 1 and 2, you will need to also compile a complete and accurate Works Cited for ALL referenced sources in your Project 3 work. This means that every image, photograph, visual, song, or sound clip, source, and text that appears in your scene staging will need to be cited on the Works Cited. 

Your Project 3 “Final for Grading” Draft should… 
Be arranged in this order: (1) Staging Explanation, (2) Scene Staging, and (3) Works Cited 
Contain a well-developed Staging Explanation that clearly identifies and explains the decisions made in the Scene Staging itself and how those decisions are connected to the key focus 
Contain a well-developed, polished Scene Staging that makes expert use of multimodal elements 
Contain a complete and accurate Works Cited in MLA format 

How do I create a Scene Staging? 
Your scene staging is a multimodal document that will make use of design elements, visuals, and sound. 

Your Scene Staging is required to feature: 
Text from the selected scene (dialogue + stage directions) 
Option #1: reproduce the text as is, and then add to it as you make reference to your staging categories 
Option #2: change some or all of the text to create your own version of the scene 
Ex: change the time period 
Decisions about at least four (4) staging categories: setting, costuming, makeup and hair, sound/music, props, lightning 
Multimodal elements to annotate the scene’s text in reference to your staging categories
Ex: use font colors, highlights, strikethrough, etc. to differentiate between Ibsen’s original words and your additions, or to color code the staging categories 
Multimodal elements to illustrate your decisions about your four selected staging categories
Ex: include images of where you want to set the scene; photographs of each character’s costume; links to songs you want as the soundtrack to that scene, etc. 

Options for your Scene Staging: 
Include working hyperlinks throughout the text of your scene staging 
Embed images and clips within the text of your essay (use media button on eLW)
Assemble all images/sound clips onto online slides or a Canva presentation, and link out to that material in text of your scene staging 

Regardless of which option you choose, you will still need to follow MLA citation practices. Each and every image, visual, sound, or song clip that is incorporated within your staging will need to be completely and accurately cited in MLA. You should plan to include the necessary captions (for images), in-text citations, and Works Cited entries. 

Consider following this suggested process to create your scene staging: 
Pick a specific scene in A Doll’s House to stage. Your scene should be 2-3 consecutive pages from the textbook. 
Analyze that scene closely, paying attention to how the events, themes, and symbolism in the scene connects to the overall meaning of the play. 
Decide on a key focus for your staging. Your key focus is your purpose in staging this scene—what you want your audience to get out of the scene as they read through your work. Your key focus should clearly result from an in-depth analysis of the play, and it should be move beyond surface level observations. 
Create the text for the scene. Either exactly reproduce Ibsen’s original work, or rewrite some/all of the scene to create your own version. 
Use multimodal design elements to help your reader identify any changes you make. 
Stage the scene by making decisions about at least four categories: setting, costuming, makeup and hair, sound/music, props, lighting
Illustrate your staging decisions by: 
Adding in additional stage directions – use design elements to help your reader identify any changes you make. 
Adding in images, visuals, and sounds to illustrate the staging decisions  
How do I create a Staging Explanation? 
Your Staging Explanation is a 1300-word minimum essay that explains your Scene Staging to your reader.  As a writer, you have a few goals: 
Identify the key focus of your scene staging
Justify that key focus with your analysis of the play
Identify your staging decisions
Explain how those staging decisions carry out your key focus 

Your Staging Explanation should have a central thesis. This thesis should be focused on explaining and justifying your staging decisions; your overall argument should be focused on identifying WHAT you have done and explaining WHY and FOR WHAT EFFECT. 

Some sample thesis statement forms include…. 
In adapting this scene to [a different setting/a different time period/etc.], I was able to [update the play’s satire/further emphasize the play’s theme of X/etc.]…
[Name of play] explores [main theme]; I augmented/enhanced/further emphasized this [theme] through…. 
The conflict between [character A] and [character b] reveals/suggest/offers commentary on [theme/topic/big picture idea]. The [key changes here] further emphasize this conflict in order to [your goal]. 

Your Staging Explanation should then provide evidence of that thesis by 
making direct references to the key changes and multimodal components of your scene staging
Explaining how those key changes are grounded in your analysis of the play (use direct quotes + analytic commentary to do so). 

As with our other projects, you will need to make strategic decisions about how to organize the information in your Staging Explanation to meet your reader’s needs: what will your reader need to know first? Second? Third? 


Required Process Work Pieces 
Process work pieces are supportive, generative assignments designed to help you craft an effective essay. Information about the assessment of these assignments can be found on the Project 3 rubric.

We have two required process work pieces for Project 3: 
Project 3 “Scene Staging Exploratory Draft”  
Project 3 “Staging Explanation and Scene Staging Draft for Writing Group” 

The process work pieces have stated word count minimums—but more content is always welcome! At this point in the writing process, don’t worry about going over the stated word count. Instead, concentrate on generating your argument and thinking through the connection among your ideas; you can also further sharpen and shorten your essay for the “Final for Grading” submission during your revisions. 

Project 3 “Scene Staging Exploratory Draft” 
Our Project 3 “Exploratory Draft” is a full draft of your Scene Staging. Your goal here is to write a good faith response to the prompt—and it is completely okay if this draft feels incomplete, disorganized, and messy! You may find it helpful to think of it as a first-pass draft, where you are “exploring” your argument, your evidence, and your organization; your ideas can and will change as you continue thinking, writing, and revising this project. Remember to cite your sources in MLA! 

Project 3 “Staging Explanation and Scene Staging Draft for Writing Group”
Our Project 3 “Draft for Writing Group” is the draft that we will share and formally workshop with our peers with our Writing Group Letters activity. In order to be considered complete, your “Draft for Writing Group” must contain a 1000-word minimum draft of your Staging Explanation and a full draft of your Scene Staging. As you expand and revise your previous draft for this submission, you may discover a completely different argument, uncover a new line or two of evidence, or completely reorganize your ideas—this is great! Remember to cite your sources in MLA. 

eLW Grading Policies 
For each required process work piece and/or draft of this project, you should create a new eLW file that is labeled with the appropriate drafting stage. 
The time of submission for each eLW file is determined by the time stamp next to “last modified/last updated.” Do not edit the eLW file containing your work after the specified due date.
























Project 3 Rubric


Process
The variety of activities that go into writing/designing which often include planning, drafting, revising, peer reviewing, proofreading, and publishing.

For Project 3, you have two pieces of required process work that count towards the final Project grade: (1) the “Exploratory Draft,” and (2) the “Draft for Writing Group.” We will submit all these assignments on eLW under “Project 3.” Each piece of required process work is worth 10 points of the overall Project 3 grade. Our process work assignments are graded on completion: whether it is submitted on time and meets the specified word count. 

20 possible points in this category. 

Argument 
How the writer convinces the reader of something. An effective argument depends on the genre. In academic writing, arguments tend to be inquiry-based or conversational, as they attempt to build knowledge by questioning existing knowledge and proposing alternatives. In nearly all genres, however, a strong argument is non-obvious and something with which a reasonable person could disagree. 

For Project 3, the argument in your Staging Explanation should provide a clear focus behind what you are trying to emphasize through your staging and the effect of the staging. The thesis should explain how you are deliberately amplifying, extending, and/or complicating some aspect of the play through your staging.  

25 possible points in this category. 

Evidence How the writer supports a claim: outside sources, anecdotes, sensory details, and/or multimodal evidence (e.g. images, sound, video, etc.) could all count as evidence depending on the assignment’s genre. Effective use of evidence also assumes the writer has evaluated the sources’ credibility, timeliness, and appropriateness for the genre of writing.  
For Project 3, the evidence in your Staging Explanation should come from (1) your analysis of the play itself and (2) your discussion of the specific decisions in your multimodal staging. For example, if you are explaining the decisions behind the lighting in your staging, you should (1) explain how that lighting decision was prompted by a specific analytic insight and (2) specifically reference the portion of your staging (i.e., stage directions + visuals) that illustrate that decision. The evidence in your Scene Staging comes from the staging itself; i.e., the links should work and the images should load. 

25 possible points in this category. 

Multimodality 
How the writer chooses multimodal elements for the text and how they combine different modes in a single text. Different sources define modes differently, so they might include: linguistic, aural, visual, spatial, and gestural modes, or written, oral, visual, electronic, and nonverbal modes. In any case, multimodality involves the intentional use of non-textual elements. 

For Project 3, the multimodal component of this assignment is most evident in your Scene Staging. You should consider how your use of the following modes enhances your staging:  
Visual Design: how the writer uses visual elements like contrast, alignment, framing, color, and other features to deliver or enhance meaning.
Audio Design: how the writer demonstrates an awareness of sonic rhetorical strategies such as voice, music, silence, sound effects, and sound interaction, with careful attention to crafting the project for listeners (as opposed to readers).
20 possible points in this category. 
Style how the writer uses words and sentences to create a tone, character, or moment-to-moment impact on the reader. 
For Project 3, you should carefully consider how to incorporate the stage directions and multimodal elements in your Scene Staging. In the Staging Explanation, you should focus on HOW your creative choices in the staging create a "tone, character, or moment-to-moment impact on the reader."
